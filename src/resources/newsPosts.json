While my focus was on mobile, you should see some improvements all across the site for just about any screen size, as many components were revamped completely to be more responsive to the size of your screen.</p> <p>If you come across any parts of the site that still look strange on mobile devices, please make a bug report in the <a href='https://discord.gg/GQ5kVyU'>discord</a>, preferably with a screenshot and information about what device and browser you're using.</p>"
